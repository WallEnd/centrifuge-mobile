This library based on [centrifuge-go](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-go) and has almost identical public API. The differences come from `gomobile` restrictions â€“ mostly because of limited type support.

There is no much sense in using this library when developing Go apps as [centrifuge-go](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-go) exists.
